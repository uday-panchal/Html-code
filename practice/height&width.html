      event  Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular 
      paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working thesis 
      statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are trying
       to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to
        that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there
         is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each
          paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your
           ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a 
           seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between
            all of the ideas in the paper.
      The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a seed
       of ideas; this “germination process” is better known as brainstorming. There are many 
       techniques for brainstorming; whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development 
       cannot be skipped. Building paragraphs can be like building a skyscraper: there must be a
        well-planned foundation that supports what you are building. Any cracks, inconsistencies,
         or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.
